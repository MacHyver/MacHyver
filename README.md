- 👋 Hi, I’m @MacHyver
- 🤓 I’m interested in coding, design, UI/UX, content creation, creating new icons and my dogs behavior 🐕🧐
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning how to use Git & GitHub and refresh my (basic) knowledge of JS, CSS, HTML, PHP, jQuery, mySQL and Photoshop.  Additionally I need to find out how to write code for mobile apps 🤔
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects without stress or pressure 
- 🃏 I also have experienced knowledge in maketing and conflict management 👍🏾
